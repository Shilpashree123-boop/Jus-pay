Payment Journey Automation with Robot Framework
This project demonstrates how to automate a payment journey in any live mobile or web application using Robot Framework. The automation flow navigates through the application to reach the second-factor authentication page (e.g., OTP page). The process includes screen recording to capture the automation flow for review.

Prerequisites
Tools and Frameworks
Robot Framework: A generic automation framework.
SeleniumLibrary: For web application automation.
AppiumLibrary: For mobile application automation.

Development Environment
Python installed on your machine (Download Python).
Robot Framework installed.
Browser drivers for Selenium:
ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, etc. (Ensure compatibility with your browser version.)
Mobile testing setup:
Appium installed and running.
A real or emulator device connected for testing.
Installation
Step 1: Clone Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Install Robot Framework and required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install robotframework
pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
pip install robotframework-appiumlibrary
pip install robotframework-screencaplibrary
Install Appium (for mobile testing):

Step 3: Setup Environment Variables
Create a .env file with the following details:




Test Flow
Launch Application:
Open the web or mobile app.
Login:
Enter test credentials.
Select Product:
Choose a product or service for purchase.
Payment Process:
Enter payment details (e.g., dummy credit card or wallet information).
Second-Factor Page:
Reach the OTP or authentication page.
Output
Execution Reports:
Robot Framework will generate a detailed report.html and log.html for each test run.
Screen Recordings:
Videos of the automated flow will be saved in the recordings/ directory.
Troubleshooting
Browser Issues:
Ensure browser drivers (e.g., ChromeDriver) are correctly installed and compatible.
Device Connection:
Verify that the mobile device/emulator is connected and recognized by Appium.
Configuration Errors:
Double-check environment variables in the .env file.
Disclaimer
Use only test accounts and dummy data to avoid any impact on production systems.
Obtain permission before automating live applications.
Comply with privacy and security policies during testing.
